The frontend of the project was made using
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and in the backend I 
have use PHP and MySQL.

I am also attaching a video with the files please must see for better
understanding.

To run the full stack application you must have install xampp
after installing Xammp you have to copy the commentApp folder after 
extracting it from the zip file to xammp's htdoc folder and  then open 
xammp control panel then start the Apache and MySQL server, after starting 
you have to go to your browser and type localhost/commentApp
this will redirect to your project in the local host apache server,
After this you will redirected to the index page that is our sign-in page.
You have to sign-up if you are a new user by clicking on Sign-up, After signup 
you can signin with your credentials.
Then the homepage of user will be redirected by signing in.
where the user can post/comment and It will get listed down.
There is also two button which show all user and active user comments like a 
filter button.There is also a logout button to end the session for the user
and make it redirected to the signin page.A forgot password page is also made 
to know your password by providing your email and secret codes.
